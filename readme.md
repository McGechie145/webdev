Design report:

I began with creating the banner. To do so I used the Dundee city council logo (they are the organization in charge of tourism).
On small screens, such as mobile devices, the banner looked bad with both the logo and text. I instituted a rule which will remove the logo when viewed on small devices.
Alternatively i could have displayed the logo followed by the text but I didn't like having the pointless logo.
Colors are based on the Dundee city council website. As is the banner logo, being used under fair use.

I also poked around their website. As they are the client i made sure to use some of their color scheme. With the blue banner and black text over a white background.

I then proceeded with a navigation bar, a simple design with three links arranged horizontally. Tested on a mobile device, with only 3 links this design was usable.

I added the open street map to the home page (index.html), made it float so the paragraphs of text would move around it. On a mobile device the map takes up the entire width with the text following below.
